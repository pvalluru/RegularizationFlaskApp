In this Project, I have performed Regularization on boston data set from sklearn.

1. I import data set from sklearn package.
2. I have written a flask application with three APIs. 
	A. /api/LinearRegression
	B. /api/LassoRegression
	C. /api/RidgeRegression
3. I collect data and saved the data in Data folder.
4. we perform LinearRegression and we calculate meanSquareError and we compare with others.

Steps:
clone the project and install required packages for the project and run.
